# Portfolio_RJQ

Very much enjoyed working on this project. I have been struggling with flex and general organization, so having to design from the ground up was great practice! I regret not commenting more as I was going, this caused some issues when debugging items towards the end. I think this sets up a great framework as I move forward in the semester to update as I go!
